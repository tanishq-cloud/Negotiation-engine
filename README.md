# Retail Commerce Negotiation Engine

## Problem Statement

In the dynamic landscape of retail commerce, effective negotiation plays a pivotal role in establishing mutually beneficial transactions. The negotiation engine addresses the complexities involved in the exchange of goods and services within a network of e-commerce participants and marketplaces.

### Key Challenges

1. **Terms of Trade:** In the Online National Marketplace (ONDC), negotiations often revolve around transaction contracts, determining the terms of trade between parties.

2. **Diverse Product Attributes:** Negotiations extend beyond trade terms and frequently involve various product attributes, such as pricing, settlement terms, and other crucial factors.

3. **Interactive Process:** The negotiation process typically consists of one party proposing terms and conditions, with the counterparty responding by either accepting, rejecting, or proposing counter-terms. This interactive nature adds intricacy to the negotiation dynamics.

4. **Termination Points:** Negotiations may conclude successfully when both parties reach a consensus on terms and conditions. Alternatively, one or both parties may decide to terminate the transaction, requiring a robust system for handling such scenarios.
